# You can go crazy and put 99 but it will take time to get to 0 xD 
# AS you can see the range basically says 10 -> 0 with a -1 every time you can modify it anyway you want
for i in range(10, 0 ,-1):
  print(str(i) + ' bottles of beer on the wall ')
  print('')
  print(str(i) + ' bottles of beer '  )
  print('')
  print('Take one down, pass it around')
  print('')
